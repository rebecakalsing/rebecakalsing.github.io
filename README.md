   <h1 style="font-size: 22px;"><b>Greetings!</b></h1> 
<p>
I <b>successfully completed</b> my first experiment with <b>HTML</b>. Explore my insights and valuable lessons learned <b>by clicking on the links</b> below. It's important to keep in mind that this is a <b>simple experiment</b>, but my experience can still <b>inspire</b> others to take the first step in <b>coding</b>. It was challenging, but rewarding. Thank you for your attention, and let's continue to learn and grow together.</p>

<P>One of the most important lessons I learned from this experiment is the importance of experiencing a project from the perspective of those involved in it. By working with code and putting myself in the shoes of developers, I was able to gain a better understanding of the challenges they face and the amount of work that goes into creating a product</P>

<A name="Define">

<P>In addition to gaining a better understanding of the development process, I also learned the importance of pushing myself to explore new areas outside of my usual skill set. By taking on this experiment, I was able to challenge myself and broaden my knowledge in a field that is not necessarily related to my day-to-day work.</P>

<A name="Ideate">
<B> Ideate </B>
<P>In the ideation phase, I worked on creating a website using HTML. It was a challenge for me since I'm not an expert in coding. However, I was determined to push myself and learn something new. I researched and explored various resources to understand how to code a website.</P>

<A name="Prototype">
<B> Prototype </B>
<P>When it came to the prototype, I started with a rough drawing of my initial design, but the biggest challenge was figuring out the HTML coordinates. I had to adapt and make changes to the image, as well as do a lot of research to find various alternatives until I got it right. It was a good lesson on the importance of being adaptable and flexible when working on a project.</P>

<P>This is my final project result, which is functional. However, the most important thing for me is to get feedback from others. I believe feedback is essential in every project to continue growing and improving.</P>
